This JavaScript code demonstrates how WebRTC is implemented for video conferencing. It creates a peer-to-peer connection between two users in a room and displays their local and remote streams on a webpage.

A few global variables, including isChannelReady, isInitiator, isStarted, localStream, pc, remoteStream, and turnReady, are first set by the code. The TURN/STUN server's configuration data is then initialized into the pcConfig variable.

The user is then prompted for a room name, which is used to establish a connection with the signaling server using Socket.io. When a user enters a room name, the signaling server creates or joins the specified room after receiving a create or join event from the client.

Next, some event handlers for the signaling server are defined in the code, including created, full, join, joined, and log. When the server creates a room, when a room is full, when a peer wants to join the room, when the current peer joins the room, and when the server logs a message, these handlers are used to log messages to the console.
